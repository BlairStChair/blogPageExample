      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Even though I made this repo in 2024, the history of this project dragged on way longer. 

        After finishing tech school with IT specialization I was thinking a lot about which IT sector I'd like to work in. I didn't have any distinct skills in any field. I knew how computers work and what parts they're made of, had some basic knowledge about administrating servers, and how to make basic websites linked with scripts and databases.</br></br>
        
        As the uni started I began to explore my interests in IT. Since high school I have been interested in administrating databases, thanks to my amazing teacher, so that's the course I decided to choose in uni. Even though I enjoy it, I still feel something pulling me in the direction of website development.</br></br>
        
        In the summer of 2023 I decided to do a simple blog website about one of my interests - in this case, taking care of carnivorous plants. My knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS was very basic at that time. I felt I couldn't create anything good enough to be proud of with my level of knowledge and experience. Because of that, it was hard for me to find the motivation to finish this project. And I never did.</br></br>
        
        At the beginning of 2024, I started doing the Odin project's course. I started seeing progress in my abilities, which boosted my confidence. I also learned to not be so hard on myself and just enjoy coding.</br></br> 
        
        In the summer of 2024, I decided to take a break from the course and make this website to turn my previous failure into my first bigger success.</br></br>
        
        The name "muchoÅ‚apa" and the logo design were taken from my first attempt at this project. I'm from Poland and I wanted to refer to Polish in the name of the website. In Polish the venus flytrap is called "muchoÅ‚apka" and "muchoÅ‚apa" is just a little changed version of that word.</br></br>
        
        Creating "muchoÅ‚apa" has been a rewarding experience, and Iâ€™m excited to continue improving, learning, and sharing my love for both coding and carnivorous plants with the world. </br></br>ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’œ</p>
