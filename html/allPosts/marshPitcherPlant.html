            <h1>Marsh Pitcher Plant</h1>
            <h3>(Heliamphora)</h3>
            <p>The Marsh Pitcher Plant is a stunning carnivorous plant native to the remote, high-altitude regions of South America. 
                Known for its elegant, tubular pitchers and distinct nectar spoon, it captures insects in a visually striking way. This plant thrives 
                in nutrient-poor environments, relying on its insect prey to supplement its diet. Read on to explore the unique environments where 
                Marsh Pitcher Plants grow and learn how to care for them in your home.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>Marsh Pitcher Plants are native to the tepui mountains of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana. These towering, 
                flat-topped plateaus provide a cool, humid environment with high rainfall and constant moisture. Heliamphora species are typically 
                found in marshy areas and along waterlogged slopes, where nutrient-poor, acidic soils force them to adapt to a carnivorous lifestyle. 
                They flourish in environments with high humidity, cool temperatures, and ample light.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide bright, indirect light or filtered sunlight. Marsh Pitcher Plants can also thrive under artificial grow lights, 
                    needing around 12-16 hours of light per day to maintain healthy growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep the soil consistently moist with distilled or rainwater. Like other carnivorous plants, they are sensitive to minerals 
                    found in tap water. A humidity tray or regular misting can help maintain moisture levels around the plant.
                <li>
                    Use a well-draining, nutrient-poor soil mix such as a combination of sphagnum moss and perlite. 
                    Avoid using standard potting soil, as it is too rich in nutrients for these plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These plants prefer cooler temperatures, ideally between 10-24°C. They can tolerate lower nighttime temperatures, 
                    which mimic their natural high-altitude environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot every 1-2 years or when the plant outgrows its container. Use fresh soil and be careful not to disturb the delicate 
                    root system during the process.
                </li>
