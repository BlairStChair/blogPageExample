            <h1>Australian Pitcher Plant</h1>
            <h3>(Cephalotus follicularis)</h3>
            <p>The Australian Pitcher Plant is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southwestern coast of Australia. 
                Known for its compact size and intricate, pitcher-shaped traps, this plant is a true marvel of the botanical world. 
                Its pitchers resemble miniature versions of the larger tropical pitcher plants, but the Australian Pitcher Plant has its own unique 
                features and beauty. Read on to explore its natural habitat and care needs.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>The Australian Pitcher Plant is endemic to a small region in southwestern Australia, where it grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils along streams 
                and in coastal swamps. It thrives in areas with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The plant is well-adapted to surviving in harsh conditions, 
                often growing in full sun or partial shade in environments with high humidity and consistent moisture.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Australian Pitcher Plant prefers bright, indirect sunlight or partial shade. In cultivation, provide 6-8 hours of light per day, 
                    avoiding harsh direct sunlight that could burn the plant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use distilled or rainwater to keep the soil consistently moist. Avoid using tap water due to its mineral content. 
                    The plant thrives with the tray method, where the pot sits in a shallow tray of water.
                <li>
                    Plant in a well-draining, acidic mix such as sphagnum moss mixed with sand or perlite. Avoid using standard potting soil, as it can harm the plant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Australian Pitcher Plants prefer moderate to high humidity levels (around 50-70%). If grown indoors, placing the plant in a terrarium or using a 
                    humidity tray can help maintain the right environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot every 1-2 years to refresh the soil and prevent overcrowding. Choose a container with good drainage and avoid disturbing the delicate roots 
                    during repotting.
                </li>
