            <h1>Sundew</h1>
            <h3>(Drosera)</h3>
            <p>Sundews are a genus of carnivorous plants known for their sticky, gland-covered leaves, 
                which they use to trap and digest insects. Belonging to the genus Drosera, these plants 
                have evolved in nutrient-poor environments, relying on insects as a supplemental source of 
                nutrients, particularly nitrogen. There are over 90 species of Sundew, varying in size and form,
                 and they can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Their specialized leaves secrete a 
                 sticky substance that mimics the appearance of dew, luring in insects. Once caught, 
                 the plant slowly digests its prey using enzymes, absorbing nutrients that support its growth 
                 and survival.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>Sundews thrive in nutrient-poor, wet environments such as bogs and marshes. 
                They are found across the globe, including the United States (particularly in the 
                Southeast), Canada, the UK, Ireland, and Scandinavia. In the Southern Hemisphere, 
                they are abundant in Australia, South Africa, and parts of South America. These 
                plants prefer sunny, humid conditions and are well-adapted to both temperate and 
                tropical climates.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide bright, indirect sunlight or artificial grow lights. 
                    Sundews thrive with 12-16 hours of light per day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use distilled or rainwater, as tap water may harm the plant.
                    Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plant in a well-draining, acidic mix, such as sphagnum moss or a 
                    peat-perlite blend. Avoid standard potting soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Maintain high humidity levels. Placing the plant in a terrarium 
                    or using a humidity tray can help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot every 1-2 years or when the plant outgrows its container. 
                    Use fresh soil mix during repotting.
                </li>
