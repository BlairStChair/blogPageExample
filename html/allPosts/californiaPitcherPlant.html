            <h1>California Pitcher Plant</h1>
            <h3>(Darlingtonia californica)</h3>
            <p>The California Pitcher Plant, also known as the Cobra Lily due to its snake-like appearance, 
                is one of the most striking carnivorous plants. With its unique, twisted pitchers and highly specialized mechanism for trapping prey, 
                this plant stands out both in the wild and in collections. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils by capturing insects in its tubular leaves, 
                which mimic a cobra ready to strike. Read on to learn about its native habitat and the specific care it needs to thrive in your home.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>The California Pitcher Plant is native to northern California and southern Oregon, where it grows in cold, nutrient-poor bogs 
                and along mountain streams. These plants are commonly found in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and lack essential 
                nutrients. They thrive in environments with cool water running through their roots, and they prefer full sunlight or partial shade 
                in these wet, mountainous regions.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide full sun or bright, indirect light. California Pitcher Plants need plenty of sunlight to thrive, 
                    but they can tolerate partial shade in especially hot climates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use distilled or rainwater to keep the soil moist at all times. Avoid tap water, as it may contain harmful minerals. 
                    To mimic their natural habitat, it's beneficial to keep the roots cool by watering with chilled water or placing the pot 
                    in a tray with cool water.
                <li>
                    Use a well-draining, nutrient-poor soil mix, such as a combination of sphagnum moss and perlite. Avoid standard potting soil, 
                    which is too rich for carnivorous plants like the California Pitcher Plant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the California Pitcher Plant does not require extremely high humidity, it performs well in environments with moderate 
                    humidity levels (around 40-60%).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot the plant every 1-2 years in fresh soil, preferably during early spring. Ensure the new soil mix mimics their natural conditions,
                     and be gentle with their root system to avoid damage.
                </li>
