            <h1>Pitcher Plant</h1>
            <h3>(Nepenthes)</h3>
            <p>The Pitcher Plant is one of the most remarkable carnivorous plants, easily recognized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped traps 
                that dangle from its leaves. Known for its ability to capture and digest insects, this tropical plant offers an exotic touch to 
                any plant collection. In this post, we’ll explore the Pitcher Plant’s native habitat and provide a guide to its care, ensuring 
                you can enjoy its unique beauty at home.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>Pitcher Plants are primarily native to tropical regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, 
                the Philippines, and Thailand. Some species are also found in Madagascar and northern Australia. These plants thrive in 
                nutrient-poor soils in rainforests, often growing as climbers in the understory or at the edges of open clearings. They prefer 
                humid environments with abundant rainfall and indirect sunlight, making high-altitude cloud forests and lowland swamps their 
                ideal habitats.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide bright, indirect sunlight or filtered light. Pitcher Plants can tolerate some direct sunlight, 
                    but too much can cause leaf burn. Aim for 8-12 hours of light per day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use only distilled or rainwater. Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Tap water 
                    should be avoided due to its mineral content, which can harm the plant.
                <li>
                    Use a mix of sphagnum moss and perlite or orchid bark to mimic the loose, well-draining soils 
                    they naturally grow in. Regular potting soil should be avoided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pitcher Plants require high humidity (60-80%) to thrive. Consider placing them in a terrarium or 
                    regularly misting to maintain moisture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot every 1-2 years or when the plant outgrows its pot. Use fresh soil to maintain the right 
                    balance of nutrients and drainage.
                </li>
