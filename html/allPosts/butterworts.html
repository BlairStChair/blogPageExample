            <h1>Butterwort</h1>
            <h3>(Pinguicula)</h3>
            <p>Butterworts are a unique group of carnivorous plants that capture prey with their sticky, glandular leaves. Unlike other carnivorous plants, 
                Butterworts have a more subtle appearance, often with bright green or purple leaves that give off a delicate shine. Their ability to trap and 
                digest small insects helps them thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This post will explore their natural habitat, as well as care tips for keeping 
                these fascinating plants at home.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>Butterworts are found across North America, Europe, and Central America, particularly in regions with nutrient-deficient soils like bogs, rocky crevices, 
                and alpine meadows. They thrive in damp, humid environments, often growing near streams or in areas that remain consistently moist. Some species prefer 
                cooler climates, while others can be found in tropical regions with milder winters.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide bright, indirect light or partial shade. Butterworts can tolerate some direct sunlight, 
                    but too much exposure may cause their delicate leaves to burn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use distilled or rainwater to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Avoid using tap water as it may contain minerals harmful 
                    to the plant. Watering from below using the tray method is ideal for maintaining consistent moisture.
                <li>
                    Plant in a well-draining, low-nutrient mix, such as a combination of peat and sand or perlite. 
                    Avoid using regular potting soil, as it is too rich for Butterworts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Butterworts prefer moderate humidity levels, ideally around 50-60%. 
                    If grown indoors, placing them near a humidity tray or misting them occasionally can help maintain proper levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot once every year or two, preferably during the plant's dormant season. Use fresh, nutrient-poor soil and avoid 
                    disturbing the plant’s shallow root system too much during the process.
                </li>
