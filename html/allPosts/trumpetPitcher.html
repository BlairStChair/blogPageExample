            <h1>Trumpet Pitcher</h1>
            <h3>(Sarracenia)</h3>
            <p>The Trumpet Pitcher is a striking carnivorous plant known for its tall, tubular leaves that form a unique pitcher shape, 
                perfect for trapping unsuspecting insects. Native to North America, this plant uses a combination of nectar, scent, 
                and visual lures to attract its prey. Read on to explore its natural habitat, as well as tips for cultivating and caring 
                for this fascinating plant at home.</p>

            <h1>Natural Habitat</h1>
            <p>Trumpet Pitchers are primarily found in the southeastern United States, with species concentrated in states like Florida, 
                Georgia, Alabama, and the Carolinas. These plants thrive in wetland environments such as bogs and fens, where the soil 
                is nutrient-poor but consistently moist. They prefer sunny, open areas with acidic soils, making these bog ecosystems 
                ideal for their growth. The high humidity and abundant insect life in these habitats provide perfect conditions for their 
                insect-catching mechanisms.</p>

            <h1>Care Requirements</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide full sunlight for optimal growth. 
                    Trumpet Pitchers need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use distilled water or rainwater. The soil should remain constantly moist, 
                    but avoid waterlogging. Do not use tap water, as it can harm the plant.
                <li>
                    Use a well-draining, acidic soil mix, such as a combination of sphagnum 
                    peat moss and perlite or sand. Avoid using regular potting soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moderate to high humidity levels (50-70%) are ideal. If the environment 
                    is too dry, consider using a humidity tray or placing the plant in a terrarium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repot every 2-3 years in fresh soil, preferably during the plant’s dormancy period in late winter or early spring.
                </li>
